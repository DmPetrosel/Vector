Also there are realized output of vector into a ```std::cout``` and ```fstream```.

There is example "Random walker" rand_walk.cpp wich output to ```std::cout``` min, average and max numbers of steps to destination with step ```step``` and repeated by n times. And average length of step. 
Also output into a file ```output.txt``` every step executed and info fetched above.

#Building#
There is Makefile to build exe file. 

Enter ```make all``` to build exe file. 

```clear``` to delete exe file
